# Control-System
The Ball and Beam System is a classical control problem used to demonstrate key concepts in feedback control and system dynamics. The objective is to stabilize a ball on a beam by manipulating the beam's angle using a servo motor.

Key features include:

Modeling the dynamics of the system.
Linearizing the system equations.
Designing and implementing controllers (PID, lead compensator).
Simulating system behavior in MATLAB and Simulink.
Constructing a physical prototype with Arduino-based hardware
